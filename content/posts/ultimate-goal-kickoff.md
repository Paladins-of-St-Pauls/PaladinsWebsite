On Sunday, five South Australian *FIRST&reg; Tech Challenge* (FTC) teams gathered together to watch the reveal video for the 2020-21 season called *Ultimate Goal*. Afterwards, we broke up to dissect all of the game rules and came up with some initial ideas for robot design and strategy.

Later in the day we presented a live stream session on behalf of *FIRST&reg; Australia*, and although there were some technical difficulties, everyone worked through it all with utmost **Gracious Professionalism**!

> *Ultimate Goal* is absolutely thrilling! The thing for me that's really awesome about the challenge is that there are so many ways to score points!

Iâ€™m very excited to begin working on a competition robot for the upcoming season over the next 8 weeks!

# You can watch the recording of our kickoff livestream below!
