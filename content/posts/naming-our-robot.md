On Wednesday the 14th of October, we had a meeting to discuss the naming of our robot. Our whole team sat down to brainstorm ideas in regard to naming conventions that can be used to ensure consistency for many seasons to come. We decided our theme would be something medieval and we liked the idea of using a medieval tool. Our team came up with so many different options for our name, but we choose Joyeuse, the legendary sword that was wielded by Charlemagne.
