The FIRST Global Challenge is a place where teams come from all around the world to compete in the Robotics Olympics. Just like the actual Olympics, the host nation changes every year. The challenge also changes, and they try to focus the challenges on problems that face our planet.  In 2020, because teams could not travel, they competed in a series of 20 technical, environmental, and problem-solving challenges.  Their solutions were submitted electronically for judging.  

Our year seven team members and our coach, Mrs. O’Malley volunteered to be judges and were lucky enough to be chosen.  We were able to have a look at all the entries and judge our assigned country’s challenges.  We were so proud of the way the countries filled out the required criteria and their ability to speak in English. We were also very astonished how well they produced and presented their challenges.
