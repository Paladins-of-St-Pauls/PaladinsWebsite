*Well, I suppose this is a tad late, but its worth posting anyway...*

Welcome to Powerplay and 2022/23, I know this post is really late, the season is almost over and we are not really working on our robot anymore, but we sort of neglected this website.

This is Cortana!

Cortana is our little creation! Cortana is fast, agile, and 100%* reliable. In case you haven't seen about FIRST or its epic philosophy. FIRST is amazing, This is my first year (pun not intended) of competing in a FIRST competition, and I can confidently say its unlike any other robotics competition, check it out [here.](https://firstinspires.org)

Cortana is a high scoring robot and is certainly our favourite robot here at the Paladins. We worked tirelessly making it and as such are very proud of Cortana.

Cortana can consistently score above 100, we have a fairly reliable 26 point autonomous and can score on high, medium, and low goals with ease.
