*Well, I suppose this is a tad late, but its worth posting anyway...*

Welcome to Powerplay and 2022/23, I know this post is really late, the season is almost over and we are not really working on our robot anymore, but we sort of neglected this website.

This is Cortana!

put image here

Cortana is our little creation! Cortana is fast, agile, and 100%* reliable. In case you haven't seen about FIRST or its epic philosophy. FIRST is amazing, This is my first year (pun not intended) of competing in a FIRST competition, and I can confidently say its unlike any other robotics competition, check it out [here.](https://firstinspires.org)

Cortana is a high scoring robot and is certainly our favourite robot here at the Paladins. We worked tirelessly making it and as such are very proud of Cortana.

Insert image of us around cortana.

Cortana can consistently score above 100, we have a fairly reliable 26 point autonomous and can score on high, medium, and low goals with ease. 

# Build



# Code

To code Cortana we used Android Studio, we have our own PaladinsOpMode classes which extend functionality on top of the standard opmodes provided by FTC. This was custom developed in house before I got here, but I have added some functionality and fixed some bugs when needed. All of our code is, like usual, available to everyone on our github. 

Over the season we ran into various small oddities in both the Driver Stations and the SDK, and here is a non-exhaustive list of some of them;

- Random crashes on the robot (fixed, was dodgy batteries)
- Random crashes on the driver station (still not fixed, they are fairly rare so its not an issue but if anyone has ideas please reach out)
- Mechanum wheels not strafing straight. (fixed, was build not code...)
- String breaking, string breaking, string breaking and a little more string breaking... (fixed, use kevlar fishing line, not string)

Those are just some of the issues we have had, if you have any solutions for any we don't, please, reach out to us.
