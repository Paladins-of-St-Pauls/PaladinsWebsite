# Zoom Meeting - 20/11/2020  
Our first Zoom meeting was held on a Friday, the second day of the lockdown. It consisted of catching up and structuring the rest of the year with the lockdown in mind and also organizing the next zoom meeting which was held on the next day.

# Zoom Meeting - 21/11/2020  
The second lockdown meeting started with a big announcement of the new website that our Captain was working on. It looked amazing, however still needed to be assembled. After the big announcement, we started by assigning notebook entries to the various members of the teams. We also did work on our judging spiel, which we assigned each person a part and work on. Near the end of meeting we decided that we should arrange a celebration and a catch up and the end of the year (if coronavirus stays away!).
