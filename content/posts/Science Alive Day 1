On Saturday the 5th of August the paladins particapted in the first of two days of fun at science alive. The paladins robot cortana was the crowd favourtie. Due to its profound curiosity and playfulness with
the kids that lined up across the front of the field. One of the drivers said that cortana enjoyed introducing itself with the people around the field with a handshake. Although cortana didn't get distracted 
due to it getting the max score of day 1 of 158 points. Which the team hasn't been able to complete since going to nationals in sydney. With the season coming to an end it has been good to see that cortana didn't
need many repairs (Although the string snapped a couple times definetly not because i was stringing the robot.....). To end with a postive the science alive was a big success with massive crowds forming around the 
game feild and the mc explaining the game. Also it was great to be able to share knowledge and explain our robot to kids all ages. It is amazing to be apart of such amazing events that shows what FIRST is all about.

See you all next season
