A few weeks ago, recently-established robotics and STEM outreach organisation, The Paladins, who compete in the *FIRST&reg; Tech Challenge* (FTC) as team 18003 needed to establish a presence online. That's when I was tasked with the design, code, installation and administration of a new website for the team. The design of the site needed to feature *'subtle complexity'*. It needed to be simple and clean, while also being eye-catching and fun - to represent a team who is open and welcoming to people interested in learning more! However, with national judging around the corner and sponsors to please, the team needed the website soon and were pleased to be presented with an initial working site design within 24 hours of the brief! After the second day of fine-tuning from team feedback, and a third day of installing a dynamically static [blogging system](https://paladins18003.org.au/posts/) (more on my techniques for this [here](/posts/making-a-modern-website/)) - the project was done!

> *I put my skills and experience in modern web development to the test to create from scratch a website for an organisation that needed to be clean, modern, fast and dynamic - all in record time!*

These days, fast, modern websites hosted on a global content delivery network (meaning very fast from anywhere in the world), do not necessarily come with a huge price tag if you know what you're doing! I was able to point the team in the direction of [Netlify](https://netlify.com), who provide exactly this service for free - perfect cost-saving for a non-profit! I also directed the team in the installation and configuration of the open-source build tool, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - allowing the website to be rapidly built and deployed to Netlify's global CDN!

As the Paladins are an organisation who love sharing with others to help everyone grow in the spirit of *Coopertition*, all of the website's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Paladins-of-St-Pauls/PaladinsWebsite)!
