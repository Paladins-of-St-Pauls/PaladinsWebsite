In 2019, The MathsMasters (Mackenzie Harty, Robert Ngo and myself) were challenged to create a video with the theme of "Maths Makes Everything Possible" to enter to the into the ChooseMaths Student Awards Competition, run by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. With all of us having a love of Music, we decided to focus the video on how "Maths Makes Music Possible". We worked hard and spent many hours researching and writing about our topic before the day we filmed in early July. The rest of the month I spent creating and animating the graphical elements and putting together a final edit.

***In early December the team had received a high commendation award from ChooseMaths for originality and effort!***
