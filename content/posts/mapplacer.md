Recently I was faced with the seemingly simple task of superimposing a historical image over current satellite imagery.

> Unsatisfied with the lack of simple solutions, I decided to make my own!

And that’s when I created MapPlacer. A simple, elegant and free solution that anyone can use to superimpose any image over a street map or satellite imagery.

# Here’s how to use it

**To add your own image(s) to the map:**

1. Move the map view to the general area where you would like to place the image.
2. Click the ‘Add Image’ button on the left (or top, if you’re using a mobile device), navigate your file system and select the image you would like to overlay.

**Here’s some things you can do:**

* Click on the image (on the map) and use the tools at the top of the image to place it in the exact location you want.
* Use the ‘Image Visibility’ button next to the image icon to change the transparency of the overlay.
* Add/remove as many images to the map as you like.
* Use the icon at the top right to change the map to switch between streetmap (default) and satellite view.
